<h2>Research in the Thompson Lab is focused on understanding the relationship 
between the structure and function of biological macromolecules, with a 
particular interest in revealing how temperature modulates this relationship.</h2>

<p>Temperature is a key variable that governs the behavior of microscopic systems. 
Contrary to this knowledge, techniques that provide the vast majority of high-resolution 
structural information about biological macromolecules, including traditional X-ray crystallography 
and cryoEM, are typically performed using cryogenically preserved samples, in order to minimize 
the effects of radiation damage. While traditional experiments provide a wealth of structural 
information about low-energy conformations, cryocooling can bias conformational ensembles and 
obscure information about fluctuations away from the lowest energy states, which are often critical 
for function under physiological conditions.</p>

<p><em>We seek to develop and apply new tools for structural biology that overcome this limitation.</em></p>

<h2>Our research efforts fall into two broad categories:</h2>

<h3>We are developing new experimental methods that utilize temperature perturbations 
to probe molecular structure and dynamics.</h3>

<div class="7u 12u$(small)">

<p> A major goal of our work is to create and democratize instrumentation, data collection protocols, 
and computational tools to facilitate high-resolution structural biology at non-cryogenic temperatures. 
We determine the structures of biological macromolecules at their physiologically relevant temperatures, 
and we use temperature as a general perturbation for static and time-resolved structural measurements. 
Collectively, these experiments allow us to map the interconversion of conformational states that underlie 
biochemical phenomena such as enzyme catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric signal transduction.</p>

<p>Our favorite method is X-ray crystallography, but we are also interested in applying our strategies across 
a variety of experimental techniques.</p>

<p> The ability to sense and respond to physiological and environmental temperature variation is pervasive 
among living systems. Understanding this phenomenon is fundamental to our understanding of life on Earth and 
how it might be affected by climate change, as well as to our understanding of human health and disease. Genetic 
and biochemical studies have identified “molecular thermometers,” for which small changes in temperature cause 
large differences in functional output, but the atomic details of the underlying mechanisms remain poorly 
understood. To address this knowledge gap, we are determining high-resolution structures of various molecular 
thermometers across their physiologically relevant temperature ranges. Our observations allow us to generate 
mechanistic, thermodynamic, and evolutionary hypotheses about the effect of temperature on structure-function 
relationships, which we test using traditional biochemical and biophysical measurements.  </p>
