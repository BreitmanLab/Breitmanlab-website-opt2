<h2>Research in the Breitman Lab is focused on (1) exploring the biodiversity and urban ecology 
of reptiles and amphibians in the Southeastern USA Coastal Plains ecoregion (<a href='https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america'>US EPA Level II Ecoregion 8.3.5</a>), 
(2) providing AUM undergraduate students with authentic faculty-led research experiences, and 
(3) 'next-generation teaching'--designing and implementing scientifically based teaching and 
peer-mentoring approaches for different class/lab settings.</h2> 
    
<p></p>Our main herpetology project is 
focused on developing a Long-Term Ecological Research Experiment (LTERE) to monitor reptile 
and amphibian communities in the AUM Forest (a 250-acre secondary forest on campus). We are expanding 
this project to other urban forests in our area and using this project to engage with the River 
Region community. To accomplish our goals for undergraduate research experiences (UREs) and science 
education research, we implement UREs in different formats (individual, CUREs) and the PI is involved 
in developing the 'Flight School' tiered peer-mentoring framework.</p>

<p>Our laboratory has spaces located on the first floor of the Goodwyn Hall Life Sciences Annex and behind 
the Science Research facility on the AUM campus in Montgomery, AL.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>We emphasize a highly interdisciplinary, collaborative, and open approach to science, 
and we are interested in applying our technical expertise to answer a variety of basic and applied questions in
biology and science education.</h2>

<h3>The lab is committed to disseminating our datasets, publishing <a href="https://github.com/BreitmanLab">our code</a>, and posting 
manuscripts on <a href="https://asapbio.org/preprint-info">preprint</a> servers where they are accessible to the general public.</h3>
