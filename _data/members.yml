  description: "Mike's longstanding research interest lies in understanding how proteins function by dynamically interconverting between different conformational states. <br/><br/>

        He was first introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, \
        where he was a research assistant in [Tom Alber](https://news.berkeley.edu/2014/04/04/berkeley-professor-thomas-alber-dies-at-60/)’s laboratory. \
        In the Alber lab, he worked on efforts to determine the structures of signaling proteins that are required for virulence in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. <br/><br/>

        In 2014, he received his Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the mentorship of [Todd Yeates](http://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/). \
        As a graduate student, Mike investigated the role of conformational polymorphism in expanding the functional diversity of a \
        key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” \
        His work revealed the role of conformational polymorphism in defining specialized functions of microcompartment shell proteins, including [ligand binding](/publications#25102080) and [allosteric regulation](/publications#25752492). <br/><br/>

        Mike joined [James Fraser's lab](https://fraserlab.com/) at [UCSF](https://ucsf.edu/) as a postdoc, where he helped develop new methods that combine temperature perturbations with static and time-resolved \
        structural measurements to provide detailed insight into the conformational landscapes of biological macromolecules. These new methods, \
        including [multi-temperature](/publications#26422513) and [temperature-jump](/publications#31527847) X-ray crystallography and solution scattering, are being applied by the Thompson lab and others to understand how \
        protein function is modulated by genetic mutations, by interactions with other molecules, and by other physical stimuli. As a postdoctoral fellow, \
        Mike was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](http://www.bioxfel.org/) (NSF), \
        a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NHLBI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and an Independent Postdoctoral Research Award from the [UCSF Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)](http://pbbr.ucsf.edu/). <br/><br/>

        In 2020, Mike was appointed as Assistant Professor in the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://chemistry.ucmerced.edu/) at [UC Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/). He is a member of the [NSF CREST-CCBM Center](https://ccbm.ucmerced.edu/) and \
        affiliate member of the [NSF BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](https://www.bioxfel.org/). He is also a member of the Participating Research Team (PRT) for [Beamline 8.3.1](https://tomalbertron.org/) at the [Advanced Light Source](https://als.lbl.gov/) and co-PI of a \
        Scientific Campaign at the [Linac Coherent Light Source](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/)."

  description: "Ralph's original background is in biology (cell biology). Somewhere along the way, he detoured and got hooked into structural biology and biochemistry. <br/><br/>

His journey in science research started back in the Philippines where he spent his undergraduate years, as a biology major. When he moved to the UK to pursue further postgraduate \
studies at the University of Sussex, he started fiddling with fruitflies. He got involved in a Drosophila cell and molecular biology project. During his time in the UK, he learned \
a variety of techniques and methodologies, including Drosophila genetics and cell biology, live cell imaging, molecular cloning, and protein purification. He eventually got \
introduced to electron microscopy (EM). <br/><br/>

He then moved to New York and worked on a collaborative project aimed at using the transmission electron microscope for molecular structure determination of membrane proteins. \
He played a key role in establishing a high-throughput pipeline for membrane protein structure determination at the New York Structural Biology Center. This electron crystallography \
pipeline consisted of protein crystallization, EM imaging, image processing, and helical reconstruction. With this pipeline, Ralph was involved in determining structures of a \
variety of proteins, mostly ion transporters such as the zinc transporter YiiP and the borate transporter Bor1p. <br/><br/>

He joined the Thompson Lab in 2021 as a research specialist, and now works jointly with the [Sukenik Lab](https://www.sukeniklab.com/). <br/><br/>

When he is not on the bench, Ralph enjoys hiking and camping. He used to be an avid badminton player but now he mostly plays volleyball. Also, he hangs out quite often with 3 dogs and 1 cat."
