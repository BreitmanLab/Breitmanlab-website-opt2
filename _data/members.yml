  description: "Mike's longstanding research interest lies in understanding how proteins function by dynamically interconverting between different conformational states. <br/><br/>

        He was first introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, \
        where he was a research assistant in [Tom Alber](https://news.berkeley.edu/2014/04/04/berkeley-professor-thomas-alber-dies-at-60/)’s laboratory. \
        In the Alber lab, he worked on efforts to determine the structures of signaling proteins that are required for virulence in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. <br/><br/>

        In 2014, he received his Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the direction of [Dr. Todd Yeates](http://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/). \
        As a graduate student, Mike investigated the role of conformational polymorphism in expanding the functional diversity of a \
        key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” \
        His work revealed the role of conformational polymorphism in defining specialized functions of microcompartment shell proteins, including [ligand binding](/publications#25102080) and [allosteric regulation](/publications#25752492). <br/><br/>

        Mike joined [James Fraser's lab](https://fraserlab.com/) at [UCSF](https://ucsf.edu/) as a postdoc, where he helped develop new methods that combine temperature perturbations with static and time-resolved \
        structural measurements to provide detailed insight into the conformational landscapes of biological macromolecules. These new methods, \
        including [multi-temperature](/publications#26422513) and [temperature-jump](/publications#31527847) X-ray crystallography and solution scattering, are being applied by the Thompson lab and others to understand how \
        protein function is modulated by genetic mutations, by interactions with other molecules, and by other physical stimuli. As a postdoctoral fellow, \
        Mike was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](http://www.bioxfel.org/) (NSF), \
        a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NHLBI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and an Independent Postdoctoral Research Award from the [UCSF Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)](http://pbbr.ucsf.edu/). <br/><br/>

        In 2020, Mike was appointed as Assistant Professor in the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://chemistry.ucmerced.edu/) at [UC Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/)."

  description: "Josh earned a B.S. in Biochemistry at CSU Fresno in 2019. There, he found an interest in structural biology and crystallography while performing research under Dr. Cory L. Brooks. \
        Josh’s research in the Brooks Lab focused on expressing and purifying novel antibody fragments that target cancerous forms of certain members of the mucin family of proteins. <br/><br/>

        In the Fall of 2020, Josh entered UC Merced’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Ph.D. program and began research in the Thompson Lab. \
        He is currently working to biochemically characterize and determine the crystal structure of human IRF-3 in complex with HIV Vpu, \
        an effort that hopes to reveal potential for host-directed antiviral therapies."

  including his development of innovative methods for detection of crumbs and other microscopic snacks from floor licking and sniffing \
  data with very low signal-to-noise. He currently studies proteins (mainly chicken and beef, but sometimes lamb or salmon), and examines, \
  at high resolution, the landscapes of orthopedic pet beds. His office hours are from 7AM-7:15AM daily - do not disturb during naps."
