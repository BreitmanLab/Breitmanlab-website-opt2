## Undergraduate Students

We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested, please send your CV/Resume to [Dr. Flor Breitman](contact/).

<!--AUM undergraduate students may sign up for courses or research with Dr. Breitman. We are interested in engaging you in conversation about your (scientific) background and career goals and providing excellent training to students who are a good fit. If interested, please contact [Dr. Flor Breitman](contact/).-->

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to Dr. Breitman. We believe that people should be fairly compensated for their work, and so if we are able to help you work out a postdoctoral fellowship to work with us, we will do all we can to set postdoc compensation to reasonable rates, and we encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Other Visitors / High School Students

We are also open to hosting other kinds of scientists who enrich our scientific environment and lab culture, including foreign exchange students, interns, and research specialists interested in collaborating, depending on project and funding availability. We are also open to working with and mentoring high school students; in fact, Dr. Breitman has experience with this. However, we cannot accommodate many high school students. Positions for high school students will be on a volunteer basis and will only be allowed for students that are the right fit. If interested please [contact us!](contact/)
