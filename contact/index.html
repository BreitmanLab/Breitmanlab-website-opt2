## Land Acknowledgement Statement

Auburn University at Montgomery is situated on land of indigenous peoples (Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Shawnee â€“ [http://www.native-lab.ca/](http://www.native-lab.ca/)); tribes that were reduced and displaced after events of ethnic cleansing and relocation. Later on, enslaved Africans and their descendants cultivated cotton fields in what is now the AUM forest and campus. Dr. Breitman recognizes the history of Alabama and the United States complicit with the racism of white supremacy; the racial realities and privileges that persist today should be recognized, honored and changed.

<!--The Fraser lab recognizes that [the University of California San Francisco sits on the unceded land of the Ramaytush Ohlone (pronounced Rah-mah-tush O-lone-ee) peoples, the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula](https://diversity.ucsf.edu/ucsf-land-acknowledgment). As settlers on this land, we want to recognize the historic, and ongoing, discrimination and violence inflicted upon Indigenous people in North America. Please read our [full statement](/land_ack).-->

## Directions to the Breitman Lab

### The AUM Campus can be reached by
* #### Car:
  * The AUM Campus is situated near the intersection of I-85 (which runs E-W through Montgomery) and Taylor Road. The street address of AUM is 7400 East Drive, Montgomery, AL 36117.
  * One option is to simply put the above street address into your GIS or maps app on your phone or electronic device, hit directions, and go!
  * The easiest way to describe getting to campus is to pass through Montgomery city limits on I-85 from either direction, take the Taylor Road exit (Exit 9) and then travel north (N) on Taylor Road until you see the campus on your left. Driving directions and additional campus maps (other than the one at the bottom of this page) are provided in great detail on the university's [Campus Maps webpage](https://www.aum.edu/about-aum/campus-maps/), which links to the official [Driving Directions and Area Maps document](https://www.aum.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/aum_directions_NP_V2.pdf) and other useful information about finding the campus and specific places at our site.

### Once on campus, proceed to Goodwyn Hall:

**Parking Option 1**

0. Travel towards the back of campus by heading for the library, which is the tallest building on campus. 
1. Reference your [Campus Map](https://www.aum.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OUM_23_05008-Updated-Campus-Map.pdf) (image below) and locate the Taylor Center (#19 on the Campus Map), a large building situated on the quad near the middle of campus.
2. There are designated temporary parking spots for visitors at the Taylor Center that visitors may use while they go inside to register with the Campus Police, so park in a visitor slot.
3. Provide your personal and vehicle information to Campus Police, who are located inside the Taylor Center, to obtain a parking pass. Campus Police may be reached by phone at (334) 244-3424 (day or night) or at parking@aum.edu (business hours).
4. Return to your vehicle and display your parking pass on your vehicle's dash.

**Parking Option 2**

0. Travel to the back (W/NW) area of campus and park your vehicle.
1. Enter campus by walking towards the library (tallest building on campus) or quad at the center of campus.
2. Locate the Taylor Center (#19 on the Campus Map), and inspect the buildings around you as you walk to the Taylor Center. You will pass Goodwyn Hall (#9 on the Campus Map), so make a note of where it is.
3. Provide your personal and vehicle information to Campus Police, who are located inside the Taylor Center, to obtain a parking pass. Campus Police may be reached by phone at (334) 244-3424 (day or night) or at parking@aum.edu (business hours).
4. Return to your vehicle and display your parking pass on your vehicle's dash.

**Meeting with Dr. B**

0. Make sure you set up a meeting time in advance by phone or email (see contact info above).
1. Once, in Goodwyn Hall (#9 on the Campus Map), take the elevator or staircase to the 2nd floor. If you take the stairs, we recommend using the staircase by the elevator, near the back of the ground floor of Goodwyn.
2. Walk around the 2nd floor hall until you see the sign for the office of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration, then enter their office area. Look for 209 O, Dr. B's office, which will be the first door on the right after you pass the DPSPA secretary's desk. If you see the Psychology Department, then you haven't gone far enough. If you see the elevator again, then you have walked all the way around our circular hallway! Turn around and find the Political Science department area where Dr. B's office is located. And remember to knock!
