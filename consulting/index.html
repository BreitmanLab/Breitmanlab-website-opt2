### Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness

#### Feedback from Flor's Student Evaluations:

_Below_, enjoy comments from students that have taken my classes at AUM (all from the IOTA online system) along the semesters I’ve been here (2021-_present_). Comments are included from different courses, semesters, years and delivery methods (online; f2f).

> BIOL 1020- CRN 1871 (Fall 2021): "Dr.B genuinely cares about her students and the material she teaches. I liked how interactive her class was and appreciated how it wasn't just sitting and taking notes-- something I have not yet seen in a class in AUM before! Helped us not only learn, but have fun doing it."
> 
> BIOL 1020 – CRN 1871 (Fall 2021): "The in class activities keep the information cycling through my head and the information is not just being taught to me but allows me to outwardly explain what i understand which improves my confidence in understanding of the material and if i have misunderstood any of the information this is perfect time for clarification."
> 
> BIOL 1021 -CRN 2193 (Fall 2021): "My professor cares about me as a student and as a person, not just about how my performance looks on paper."
> 
> BIOL 1021 – CRN 1900 (Fall 2022): "Dr. B cares about everyone and their grades. She has helped me all semester because I struggle with Science, so having a professor like her has been amazing!"
> 
> BIOL 1027 – CRN 2149 (Fall 2022, honors sec.) "Dr. B is a great professor who genuinely cares for her students (in all three years I have been at AUM she is the best / most personal professor I have met). She absolutely loves what she does and it is evident in her teaching. She also does everything she can for her students to succeed."
> 
> BIOL 3700 – CRN 3028 (Spring 2023): "Measuring the butterfly and mapping the butterflies give me practical and GIS skills that i can apply real life skills."
> 
> BIOL 3932 – CRN 3029 (Spring 2023): "Dr. B really made me feel heard. She always listens and is always there with helpful advice. She really made my last semester better just by listening."
> 
> BIOL 1020-OL1- 30526 (Summer 2023, online): "Dr. B cares about the content and her students. It is readily apparent that she wants you to learn and is there for you. She is incredibly responsive, even during off hours."
> 
> BIOL 1020-OL1- 30526 (Summer 2023, online): "You are an absolutely amazing professor! As a Troy University transient student, this was my first experience with AUM and because of my experience taking your courses, I am adding AUM to my graduate school possibilities."
> 
> BIOL 1020-OL1- 30526 (Summer 2023, online): "Dr. Breitman was extremely helpful and understanding in this class. At the beginning of the semester I missed 2 and 1/2 for military training. She worked with me through out the whole semester and responded to my emails in a timely manner. Her syllabus was easy to follow. Her assignments where a little hard but rewarding. I would recommend Dr. Breitman to any college student who wants to learn, have an understanding professor, and enjoy learning the material."
