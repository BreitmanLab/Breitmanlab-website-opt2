on July 7th to 10th the Thompson lab traveled to San Fransisco to attend the 36th symposium of the Protein Society. In the symposium's 
poster competition, our lab participated with three posters. Alexander (Wolf), Behnoush and Josh presented their works with posters 
and flash talk. As well as the great opportunity to learn, and communicate with the experts in the field of protein science, the lab
members had a lot of fun exploring the beautiful city of San Fransisco together.
