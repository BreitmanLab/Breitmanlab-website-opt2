Behnoush is also chosen to present a poster and give a flash talk about her project on “Using Crystallographic Ensemble Refinement for
 Computational Design of Highly Active De Novo Enzymes”. Thompson lab Ph.D. student Joshua Rodriguez and the lab’s senior researcher 
Alexander Wolf are also going to present posters at this event.
