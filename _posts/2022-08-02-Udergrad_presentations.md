Our undergrads' summer fellowships in the Thompson lab were concluded this August. Andree, Dondis, and Vincent all did a great job this 
summer in the lab. 

They presented a summary of their work over the summer as posters and talks this week. Andree and Dondis both had a poster and a 
presentation at the BioXFEL conference, and Vincent presented his work at the UC Merced UROC conference. These events were a really 
good opportunity for them to share their research with others in their field.
