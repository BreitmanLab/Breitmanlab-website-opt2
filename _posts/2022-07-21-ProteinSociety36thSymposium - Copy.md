From July 6th to 10th the Thompson lab traveled to San Fransisco to attend the 36th Annual Symposium of the Protein Society. Our lab presented three posters. Alex, Behnoush, and Josh presented their work with posters, and Behnoush gave a short flash talk. The lab members had a lot of fun exploring the beautiful city of San Fransisco together, along with great opportunities to learn and communicate with  experts in the field of protein science.
