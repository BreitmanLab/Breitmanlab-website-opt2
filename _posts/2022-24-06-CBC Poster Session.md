This friday, UC Merced's deparment of Chemistry and Biochemistry (CBC) held a poster session for its first-year graduate students
to have a chance to share their research with other department members. Behnoush and Luisa from our lab presented posters on 
"ensemble-based protein design, a new method for increasing De Novo enzyme activity" and "CLKs, the temperature sensative kinases" 
respectively.
