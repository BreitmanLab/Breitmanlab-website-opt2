							<p><!-- In the Keedy Lab, we are interested in the "secret lives" of protein structures:
how they move when we''re not looking,
how their motions contribute to biology,
and how they are regulated to control how proteins function in cells.

We use cutting-edge experiments in structural biology, especially X-ray crystallography,
combined with computational analysis of three-dimensional models,
to elucidate how proteins move and how that matters for biology.

<!-- ## What are the "secret lives" of protein structures?

<img src="/images/slide_alt_confs_density.jpg" height="300" align="right"/>
For protein molecules, structure is critical to function.
But proteins don't like to sit still!
The alternative conformations of proteins,
which are often overlooked by traditional structural biology methods,
can provide key insights into biological processes.
We are exploring new methods in X-ray crystallography for revealing
the **"hidden" conformational ensembles** of proteins
and incorporating them into new types of three-dimensional models.
Our goal is to develop new methods to
characterize excursions from the average structure in proteins
and to explore the implications of those excursions for biology.

<h2>Research in the Thompson Lab is focused on understanding the relationship 
between the structure and function of biological macromolecules, with a 
particular interest in revealing how temperature modulates this relationship.</h2>

</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="5u 12u$(small)">

<p>Temperature is a key variable that governs the behavior of microscopic systems. 
Contrary to this knowledge, techniques that provide the vast majority of high-resolution 
structural information about biological macromolecules, including traditional X-ray crystallography 
and cryoEM, are typically performed using cryogenically preserved samples, in order to minimize 
the effects of radiation damage. While traditional experiments provide a wealth of structural 
information about low-energy conformations, cryocooling can obscure information about fluctuations 
away from the lowest energy states, which are often critical for function under physiological 
conditions.</p>

<p><em>We seek to develop and apply new tools for structural biology that overcome this limitation.</em></p>

<h2>Our research efforts fall into two broad categories:</h2>

<h3>We are developing new experimental methods that utilize temperature perturbations 
to probe molecular structure and dynamics.</h3>

</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="8u 12u$(small)">

<p> A major goal of our work is to create and democratize instrumentation, data collection protocols, 
and computational tools to facilitate high-resolution structural biology at non-cryogenic temperatures. 
We determine the structures of biological macromolecules at their physiologically relevant temperatures, 
and we use temperature as a general perturbation for static and time-resolved structural measurements. 
Collectively, these experiments allow us to map the interconversion of conformational states that underlie 
biochemical phenomena such as enzyme catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric signal transduction.</p>
<p>Our favorite method is X-ray crystallography, but we are also interested in applying our strategies across 
a variety of experimental techniques.</p>

<h3>We are uncovering the atomic-scale mechanisms of the "molecular thermometers" that 
allow living systems to sense and respond to temperature.</h3>

<p> The ability to sense and respond to physiological and environmental temperature variation is pervasive 
among living systems. Understanding this phenomenon is fundamental to our understanding of life on Earth and 
how it might be affected by climate change, as well as to our understanding of human health and disease. Genetic 
and biochemical studies have identified “molecular thermometers,” for which small changes in temperature cause 
large differences in functional output, but the atomic details of the underlying mechanisms remain poorly 
understood. To address this knowledge gap, we are determining high-resolution structures of various molecular 
thermometers across their physiologically relevant temperature ranges. Our observations allow us to generate 
mechanistic, thermodynamic, and evolutionary hypotheses about the effect of temperature on structure-function 
relationships, which we test using traditional biochemical and biophysical measurements.  </p>

<h2>We often ask questions at the boundaries of current technical limitations, creating

<h3>We maintain close collaborations with scientists and engineers at X-ray lightsources around the world. </h3> 

<p>Our experiments extensively utilize synchrotron beamlines, including BL8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source 
(Lawrence Berkeley National Lab), the BioCARS facility at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Lab), 
and beamlines at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SLAC National Accelerator Lab). 
Additionally, we use X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) located at the Linac Coherent Light Source (SLAC) 
and the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Linear Accelerator (RIKEN, Japan).</p>
